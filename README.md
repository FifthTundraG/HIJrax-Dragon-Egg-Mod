# HiJrax's Dragon Egg Mod
Changes how the dragon egg works in order to incentivize keeping it in your inventory at all times.

Whoever has the dragon egg:
- Obtains double health (10 -> 20 hearts)
- Gets special crown around their head at all times
- Has a purple nametag in the tablist, chat, and above their head.

But wait! There's more!

The dragon egg can also no longer be placed in ender chests, bundles, or shulker boxes. Now if you have the egg, you can't hide it away where it can no longer be found ;)
